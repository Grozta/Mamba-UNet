## Q&A

1. Q: Performance: I find my results are slightly lower than your reported results.

A: Please do not worry. The performance depends on many factors, such as how the data is split, how the network is initialized, how you write the evaluation code for Dice, Accuray, Precision, Sensitivity, Specificity, and even the type of GPU used. What I want to emphasize is that you should maintain your hyper-parameter settings and test some other baseline methods(fair comparsion). If method A has a lower/higher Dice Coefficient than the reported number, it's likely that methods B and C will also have lower/higher Dice Coefficients than the numbers reported in the paper.

2. Q: Network Block: What is the network block you used? What is the difference between Mamba-XXXNet?

A: I understand that there are so many Mamba related papers now, such as Vision Mamba, Visual Mamba, SegMemba... In this project, I integrate VMamba into U-shape network. The reference of VMamba is: Liu, Yue, et al. "Vmamba: Visual state space model." arXiv preprint arXiv:2401.10166 (2024).

3. Q: Concurrent Work: I found similar work about the integration of Mamba into UNet.

A: I am glad to see and acknowledge that there should be similar work. Mamba is a novel architecture, and it is obviously valuable to explore integrating Mamba with segmentation, detection, registration, etc. I am pleased that we all find Mamba efficient in some cases. This GitHub repository was developed on the 6th of February 2024, and I would not be surprised if people have proposed similar work from the end of 2023 to future. Also, I have only tested a limited number of baseline methods with a single dataset. Please make sure to read other related work around Mamba/Visual Mamba with UNet/VGG/Resnet etc.

4. Q: Other Dataset: I want to try MambaUNet with other segmentation dataset, do you have any suggestions?

A: I recommend to start with UNet, as it often proves to be the most efficient architecture. Based on my experience with various segmentation datasets, UNet can outperform alternatives like TransUNet and SwinUNet. Therefore, UNet should be your first choice. Transformer-based UNet variants, which depend on pretraining, have shown promising results, especially with larger datasetsâ€”although such extensive datasets are uncommon in medical imaging. In my view, MambaUNet not only offers greater efficiency but also more promising performance compared to Transformer-based UNet. However, it's crucial to remember that MambaUNet, like Transformer, necessitates pretraining (e.g. on ImageNet).

5. Q: Colloboration: Could I discuss with you about other topic, like Image Registration, Human Pose Estimation, Image Fusion, and etc.

A: I would also like to do some amazing work. Connect with me via ziyang [dot] wang17 [at] gmail [dot] com.
